# CDAC_PROJECT

This project seeks to create an advanced machine learning model capable of forecasting the prices of second-hand automobiles. By harnessing the power of past data encompassing diverse car attributes and their corresponding prices, the model will discern intricate patterns and interconnections. Consequently, it will be able to provide precise estimations of a used car's value, taking into account its distinctive characteristics.
The endeavor encompasses several pivotal stages: commencing with data collection, followed by meticulous data preprocessing, strategic feature engineering, judicious model selection, rigorous model training, comprehensive model evaluation, and finally culminating in the seamless deployment of the predictive model.
